## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze Uber ride data to extract actionable insights that can guide business decisions. By focusing on ride purposes, temporal usage, and distance patterns, the analysis reveals valuable trends in customer preferences and Uberâ€™s usage dynamics.

---

## Key Features

- Identification of dominant ride purposes (e.g., business trips).
- Temporal analysis to highlight peak usage hours and seasonal trends.
- Distance analysis to determine common trip ranges and preferences.
- Categorical variable relationships to understand correlations.
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure accurate analysis.

---

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Missing values in the 'PURPOSE' column are replaced with "NOT."
   - Rows with duplicates are removed.

2. **Date-Time Formatting**:
   - Converted `START_DATE` to datetime format.
   - Extracted month, day, and time details.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Categorized time into day and night periods.
   - Applied One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical variables to numerical form.

## Insights

### Trip Characteristics
- **Business Trips Dominate**: Most rides are for business purposes, with meetings and meals/entertainment being the top reasons.
  
### Temporal Patterns
- **Peak Usage**: Rides peak between 10 AM - 5 PM.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Fewer rides are observed during winter months (November - January).

### Distance Analysis
- **Common Range**: Most rides fall within the 0-20 mile range, with very few exceeding 20 miles.

### Categorical Variable Relationships
- **Business vs. Personal**: A strong negative correlation exists between these categories.

### Data Distribution
- **Category and Purpose Plots**: Visualizations highlight the distribution of ride purposes and categories.
- **Day-Night Analysis**: Trips are analyzed based on their time of occurrence.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

## Conclusion

The analysis provides key insights into Uber ride usage, emphasizing its practicality for business trips and short-to-moderate distances. By understanding temporal and seasonal trends, Uber can optimize its resources and enhance service quality. The project also demonstrates effective data preprocessing and visualization techniques.
